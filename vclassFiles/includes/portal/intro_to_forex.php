Foreign Exchange known as (Forex) is a $4 trillion-dollar a day global market, it is different
from the stock market even though many people are still confused about that. In it, traders
from across the globe from the biggest financial institutions to private individuals like me
invest in the strengthening of one currency versus another currency. It is a slightly different
investment to what most people consider an investment. As a career, Forex trading is quite
different to what most people see as a “standard” career. For many people earning a living out of
trading financial markets online is seen as non-traditional way of investing. For those
reasons, Forex trading becomes a very lonely business, not many people really understand what it
is all about, and it is foreign to many. As a Forex trader, you need to be dedicated and committed.
Forex trading is not a pyramid scheme; you can be set up for life if you can learn the skill.
Forex trading offers the opportunity to be independent, but only to those who are passionate and
really want to make it work. I am talking about being sensible as well as treating it like a real
business, not like a hobby.

        <b> NOT EVERYBODY IS PERFECTLY “SUITED” FOR TRADING: </b><br>
• Only goal driven can survive and make it to the top, yess!! I have said it, make it to the top
trading the financial markets, it is possible.<br>
• Only the kind of people who are OK with doing something that is out of the ordinary.<br>
• You can easily turn it into gambling if all you are looking for is quick cash.<br>
• If you are looking for a quick fix, this is not for you, try something else.

            <h4><b> THE OVERVIEW ON FOREX </b></h4><br>
        <p class="text-justify">
        <h5><b>What is FOREX?</b></h5>
The Foreign Exchange market, also referred to as the "FOREX" or "Forex" or "Retail
forex" or “FX” or "Spot FX" or just "Spot" is the largest financial market in the
world, with a volume of about $2 trillion a day. If you compare that to the $25
billion a day volume that the New York Stock Exchange trades, you can easily see
how enormous the Foreign Exchange really is. It actually equates to more than
three times the total amount of the stocks and futures markets combined! Forex
rocks!<br><br>
<b>What is traded on the Foreign Exchange?</b><br>
The simple answer is money. Forex trading is the simultaneous buying of one
currency and the selling of another. Currencies are traded through a broker or
dealer, and are traded in pairs; for example the Euro dollar and the US dollar
(EUR/USD) or the British pound and the Japanese Yen (GBP/JPY).<br>
Because you're not buying anything physical, this kind of trading can be confusing.
Think of buying a currency as buying a share in a particular country. When you
buy, say, Japanese Yen, you are in effect buying a share in the Japanese economy,
as the price of the currency is a direct reflection of what the market thinks about
the current and future health of the Japanese economy.<br>
In general, the exchange rate of a currency versus other currencies is a
reflection of the condition of that country's economy, compared to the
other countries' economies.<br>
Unlike other financial markets like the New York Stock Exchange, the Forex spot
market has neither a physical location nor a central exchange. The Forex market is
considered an Over-the-Counter (OTC) or 'Interbank' market, due to the fact that
the entire market is run electronically, within a network of banks, continuously over
a 24-hour period.<br>
Until the late 1990’s, only the “big guys” could play this game. The initial
requirement was that you could trade only if you had about ten to fifty million
bucks to start with! Forex was originally intended to be used by bankers and large
institutions - and not by us “little guys”. However, because of the rise of the
Internet, online Forex trading firms are now able to offer trading accounts to 'retail'
traders like us.<br>
All you need to get started is a computer, a high-speed Internet connection, and
the information contained within this site.
BabyPips.com was created to introduce novice or beginner traders to all the
essential aspects of foreign exchange, in a fun and easy-to-understand manner.<br><br>
<b>What is a Spot Market?</b><br>
A spot market is any market that deals in the current price of a financial
instrument.<br>
Which Currencies Are Traded?<br>
The most popular currencies along with their symbols are shown below:<br>
<b>Symbol Country Currency Nickname</b><br>
<b>• USD</b> United States Dollar Buck<br>
<b>• EUR</b> Euro members Euro Fiber<br>
<b>• JYP</b> Japan Yen Yen<br>
<b>• GBP</b> Great Britain Pound Cable<br>
<b>• CHF</b> Switzerland Franc Swissy<br>
<b>• CAD</b> Canada Dollar Loonie<br>
<b>• AUD </b>Australia Dollar Aussie<br>
<b>• NZD</b> New Zealand Dollar Kiwi<br>
<b></b>Forex currency symbols are always three letters, where the first two letters identify
the name of the country and the third letter identifies the name of that country’s currency.

    <h5> <b> Why Trade Foreign Currencies? </b></h5> 
        
There are many benefits and advantages to trading Forex. Here are just a few
reasons why so many people are choosing this market:<br>
<b>• No commissions.</b><br>
No clearing fees, no exchange fees, no government fees, no brokerage fees.
Brokers are compensated for their services through something called the bid-ask
spread.<br>
<b>• No middlemen.</b><br> 
Spot currency trading eliminates the middlemen, and allows
you to trade directly with the market responsible for the pricing on a particular
currency pair.<br> 
In the futures markets, lot or contract sizes are determined by the exchanges. A
standard-size contract for silver futures is 5000 ounces. In spot Forex, you
determine your own lot size. This allows traders to participate with accounts as
small as $250 (although we explain later why a $250 account is a bad idea).<br> 
<b>• Low transaction costs.</b><br> 
The retail transaction cost (the bid/ask spread) is typically less than 0.1 percent
under normal market conditions. At larger dealers, the spread could be as low
as .07 percent. Of course this depends on your leverage and all will be explained
later.<br> 
<b>• A 24-hour market.</b><br> 
There is no waiting for the opening bell - from Sunday evening to Friday
afternoon EST, the Forex market never sleeps. This is awesome for those who
want to trade on a part-time basis, because you can choose when you want to
trade--morning, noon or night.<br> 
<b>• No one can corner the market.</b><br> 
The foreign exchange market is so huge and has so many participants that no
single entity (not even a central bank) can control the market price for an
extended period of time.<br> 
<b>• Leverage.</b><br> 
In Forex trading, a small margin deposit can control a much larger total contract
value. Leverage gives the trader the ability to make nice profits, and at the
same time keep risk capital to a minimum. For example, Forex brokers offer 200
to 1 leverage, which means that a $50 dollar margin deposit would enable a
trader to buy or sell $10,000 worth of currencies. Similarly, with $500 dollars,
one could trade with $100,000 dollars and so on. But leverage is a double-edged
sword. Without proper risk management, this high degree of leverage can lead
to large losses as well as gains.<br> 
<b>• High Liquidity.</b><br> 
Because the Forex Market is so enormous, it is also extremely liquid. This means
that under normal market conditions, with a click of a mouse you can
instantaneously buy and sell at will. You are never "stuck" in a trade. You can
even set your online trading platform to automatically close your position at
your desired profit level (a limit order), and/or close a trade if a trade is going
against you (a stop loss order).<br> 
<b>• Free “Demo” Accounts, News, Charts, and Analysis.</b><br>  
Most online Forex brokers offer 'demo' accounts to practice trading, along with breaking Forex
news and charting services. All free! These are very valuable resources for
“poor” and SMART traders who would like to hone their trading skills with 'play'
money before opening a live trading account and risking real money.<br> 
<b>• “Mini” and “Micro” Trading:</b><br> 
You would think that getting started as a currency trader would cost a ton of
money. The fact is, compared to trading stocks, options or futures, it doesn't.
Online Forex brokers offer "mini" and “micro” trading accounts, some with a
minimum account deposit of $300 or less. Now we're not saying you should
open an account with the bare minimum but it does makes Forex much more
accessible to the average (poorer) individual who doesn't have a lot of start-up
trading capital.

    <h4> <b> How You Make Money Trading Forex </b></h4> 
    In the FX market, you buy or sell currencies. Placing a trade in
the foreign exchange market is simple: the mechanics of a
trade are very similar to those found in other markets (like the
stock market), so if you have any experience in trading, you
should be able to pick it up pretty quickly.
The object of Forex trading is to exchange one currency for another in the
expectation that the price will change, so that the currency you bought will increase
in value compared to the one you sold.<br>

    <h4> <b> Types of Trading </b></h4> 
 
There are 2 basic types of analysis you can take when approaching the forex:<br>
1. Fundamental analysis<br>
2. Technical analysis.<br>
There has always been a constant debate as to which analysis is better, but to tell
you the truth, you need to know a little bit of both. So let’s break each one down
and then come back and put them together.<br>
<b>Fundamental Analysis</b><br>
Fundamental analysis is a way of looking at the market through economic, social
and political forces that affect supply and demand. (Yada yada yada.) In other
words, you look at whose economy is doing well, and whose economy sucks. The
idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country’s economy is doing well, their
currency will also be doing well. This is because the better a country’s economy,
the more trust other countries have in that currency.
For example, the U.S. dollar has been gaining strength because the U.S. economy
is gaining strength. As the economy gets better, interest rates get higher to control
inflation and as a result, the value of the dollar continues to increase. In a
nutshell, that is basically what fundamental analysis is.

<br>
<b>Technical Analysis</b><br>
Technical analysis is the study of price movement. In one word, technical analysis
= charts. The idea is that a person can look at historical price movements, and,
based on the price action, can determine at some level where the price will go. By
looking at charts, you can identify trends and patterns which can help you find
good trading opportunities.<br>
The most IMPORTANT thing you will ever learn in technical analysis is the trend!
Many, many, many, many, many, many people have a saying that goes, “The trend
is your friend”. The reason for this is that you are much more likely to make
money when you can find a trend and trade in the same direction. Technical
analysis can help you identify these trends in its earliest stages and therefore
provide you with very profitable trading opportunities.
Now I know you’re thinking to yourself, “Geez, these guys are smart. They use
crazy words like "technical" and "fundamental" analysis. I can never learn this
stuff!” Don't worry yourself too much.<br>

    <h4> <b> What is a Candlestick? </b></h4> 
Back in the day when Godzilla was still a cute little lizard, the Japanese created
their own old school version of technical analysis to trade rice. <br>A westerner by the
name of Steve Nison “discovered” this secret technique on how to read charts from
a fellow Japanese broker and Japanese candlesticks lived happily ever after. Steve
researched, studied, lived, breathed, ate candlesticks, began writing about it and
slowly grew in popularity in 90s. To make a long story short, without Steve Nison,
candle charts might have remained a buried secret. Steve Nison is Mr. Candlestick.<br>
Okay so what the heck are candlesticks?<br>
The best way to explain is by using a picture:<br>
<img src="../vclass/images/candlesticks.jpg" alt=""/><br>
  Candlesticks are formed using the open, high, low and close.<br>
• If the close is above the open, then a hollow candlestick (usually displayed as
white) is drawn.<br>
• If the close is below the open, then a filled candlestick (usually displayed as
black) is drawn.<br>
• The hollow or filled section of the candlestick is called the “real body” or body.<br>
• The thin lines poking above and below the body display the high/low range and
are called shadows.<br>
• The top of the upper shadow is the “high”.<br>
• The bottom of the lower shadow is the “low”.<br>
