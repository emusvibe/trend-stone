But the opportunity to profit from trading in forex also makes it a favoured trading instrument for a wide range of traders, such as banks and other financial institutions, governments, corporations and individual investors.

Currency pairs are quoted as such because a currency is only valuable in relation to another currency. The value of a domestic good in an open market is very easy to determine - just look at the current market price. In this instance, the value of the good is essentially being compared to the currency. Therefore, when quoting the value of a currency, it must also be valued against something else.</div>

You research the share price of a company that you are interested in, e.g. ABSA Bank. You will form an opinion t that the share price will either increase or decrease in the future. If you think the price will go up you "buy" the share price. If you think the price will go down you "sell" the share price. If your opinion is correct, you will make a profit, but if your opinion is incorrect, you will make a loss</div>

• You can open an account in minutes<br>

• All trades are executed immediately<br>
• You can limit the extent of any losses<br>
• You can protect or hedge an existing investment with a spread trade

                            <div class="panel-body">• It requires a much smaller outlay (typically 10-15%) to make the same profit as would be derived from investing in shares<br>
• There is no currency risk when trading in overseas instruments denominated in other currencies<br>
• In addition to shares, you can trade<br>
indices, currencies, and commodities<br>

When recording your trade with your broker, you can state the maximum you are prepared to lose. This is called a "Stop Loss" and your position is automatically cut when you reach the loss limits you have specified. In addition, a loss-making trade can be terminated at any time, thus limiting any potential losses. You can stop the extent of the loss immediately by a phone call or by placing a 'counter' trade online. This is called "closing your position" and it is instantaneous, no waiting to contact a broker or hoping to find a buyer for your shares.

The idea behind this type of analysis is that if a country's economy is doing well, their currency will also be doing well. This is because the better a country's economy, the more trust other countries have in that currency.</div>
